BMesh for Unity
===============

This Unity package is a library to make runtime procedural mesh generation as flexible as possible.

The mesh structure is similar to [the one used in Blender](https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Source/Modeling/BMesh/Design), and a mechanism for adding arbitrary attributes to vertices/edges/loops/faces is available, for instance for people used to [Houdini's wrangle nodes](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/nodes/sop/attribwrangle.html).

Getting Started
---------------

**NB:** *You can also find [BMesh for Unity on the asset store]().*



Going further
-------------

Now that you know the basics, you can simply look at the source files, they are commented before each function.

Contributing
------------

This library is still young, and far from being a complete toolkit. Whenever you find yourself writing operators that are somehow reusable, you are more than welcome to contribute back, by sending a pull request here for instance. Contribution can also be the identification of weak parts of the current design of the library.
